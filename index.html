                <h3>Piano Anatomy</h3>
                <p>A piano has many parts and each part is essential to making the piano work. Each key is connected to a string that is hit with a small hammer inside the piano causing the string to vibrate and create sound. The tightness of the string determines how high or low the pitch is. The tighter the string the higher the pitch. Every piano is slightly different, however, and keys can sound different from piano to piano.</p>
